README for Homework 2:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[If you want to look at some more examples of IA32 programming, then be
sure to look in the "examples" directory, starting with "examples.txt".]

You can use the files in this directory to test your assembly language
programs.  I have tested these files on four different platforms:

  Linux (Ubuntu, on the linuxlab.cs.pdx.edu machines)
  Linux (Fedora Core)
  Windows XP
  Mac OS X (Intel)

They should also work easily on other platforms, including other
versions of Linux, or other Unix-like operating systems such as FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, or NetBSD.  Note, however, that they all rely on the use of an
IA32 compatible processor, so they will NOT run correctly on a machine
that uses a different kind of processor such as a Sparc (e.g., the
departmental cs.pdx.edu Solaris machines) or a PowerPC (e.g., an older,
pre-Intel Mac).

If you have the appropriate tools installed (see below for platform
specific details), you should be able to compile the code in this
directory using one of the following lines, depending on the platform
that you use:

  gcc -m32 -o main main.c linux.s   (on a Linux machine)
  gcc -m32 -o main main.c mac.s     (on an Intel Mac)
  gcc -m32 -o main main.c windows.s (on a Windows XP PC)

Now you can run the compiled binary using the following command line:

  ./main

(Don't forget the leading ./ part, just in case you have a path setting
that doesn't include the current directory!)  This test program should
display a simple "result is 42" message and then exit.

When you are ready to start writing and testing your own code, you
should look for the following code in whichever .s file you are using:

  ### This is where your code begins ...
  
          movl    $42, %eax     # replace this with your code!
  
  ### This is where your code ends ...

As the comments suggest, you should put your code here!  You can
assume that the registers esi and edi have been initialized to contain
the start addresses of the first and second images, respectively, at
the top of this code, and you should ensure that you have loaded the
final result into the eax register at the end.

You might want to create several different copies of the appropriate .s
file, one for each part of the question, so that you can compare and
reuse code from each answer without having to comment out multiple
versions in a single file or, worse still, overwriting your answer to
one part with the answer to another.  Of course, you'll have to use a
different command line to gcc after that to include the name of the new
.s file.


Platform Specific Notes:

Departmental Machines: Unless you have a strong preference or need
to use your own machine for this homework, I encourage you to consider
using the departmental machines in the Linux lab.  Just login in to
linuxlab.cs.pdx.edu to access these machines; they already have the
appropriate versions of the tools installed, so you don't need to
do anything extra yourself!

If you are keen, for whatever reason, to do this homework using your
own machine, then I hope that the following instructions will help
to get you up and running on Linux, Windows XP, or Mac OS X (Intel).

Linux: Most linux installations already have the necessary
packages installed, but if you don't have gcc, then you will
need to install it using whatever tools you normally use to add
packages; this varies from one distribution to the next so I'm
afraid I can't help with more specifics.

Mac OS X: You'll need one of the newer Intel Macs for this work;
the previous generation of Macs use a PowerPC processor, so they
can't run Intel code (and may not include the tools that you
need to generate x86 binaries).  You should have received a CD/DVD
with the developer tools on it when you received your Mac (or
you can download a (probably more recent) version from the Apple
Developer Connection website, which is free, although I think you
have to register).  Once you've located the package, you can
just double click on it to begin the installation.

Windows:  I recommend using the cygwin toolset, which you can
obtain for free from www.cygwin.com.  Start by downloading and
running the setup.exe file that is available on the home page
there.  When you get the "Select Packages" dialog on screen, open
up the "Devel" list, scroll down to find "gcc" and select it by
clicking on the "Skip" until it shows the most recent version.
(For me, this was just a single click and the version I got was
3.4.4-3; you might find something more recent when you try.)
Selecting gcc will automatically select a bunch of other files
that are needed to make it work (including the assembler in the
"binutils" package) so you won't need to do anything else.
Proceed to download the listed packages ... this may take a little
while; there are quite a few of them!  Once the install is
finished, you will be given a chance to deselect some checkboxes
to indicate whether or not you want a short cut to be added to you
desktop.  I suggest that you leave the box checked, and then, when
the installer finishes, use the shortcut to start a cygwin shell.

If you used the default setting of c:\cygwin for your install
directory, then you should create a new folder c:\cygwin\hw2
and copy the main.c and windows.s files there.  Now, in your
cygwin prompt window, you should be able to compile and run
the supplied program using the following commands:

  cd /hw2
  gcc -m32 -o main main.c windows.s
  ./main

Good luck, and have fun!!
