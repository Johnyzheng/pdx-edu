Ted Timmons
CS321 assignment 2


Parts 1 and 2 of the assignment are combined in parser.jflex; part 3 is in htmlparser.jflex and color/Highlighter.java. Sources for "borrowed" code segments are given.

Test files are shown in the typescript, as well as compilation results. jflex-generated code is not included per email instructions that it wasn't required.
